# Web Crawler for GE Digital

The project was built originally under Windows.  No build scripts are provided
for Linux environments.

The project also requires gson-2.8.5.jar.  In the dev environment, this is
placed in the same directory as the batch files.

Use build.bat to compile the project.
Use test0.bat to execute the code with no input file (not very exciting).
Use test1.bat to execute the code using Internet 1.
Use test2.bat to execute the code using Internet 2.
